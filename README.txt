## 📝 How to Run This Catering Reservation
Step 1: Setup the Environment
You will need a code editor to edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
You need to create a Firebase project for the backend to manage authentication, products, and orders.
Step 2: Configure Firebase
Set up Authentication in Firebase so users can register and log in securely.
Use Firestore to store product details, user orders, and user profiles.
Store images (if any) in Firebase Storage.
Copy the Firebase configuration code into your JavaScript to connect the website with Firebase.
Step 3: Build the Frontend
Develop user-facing pages:
login
register
view products
add to cart
place order
Develop admin pages:
upload products
view orders
Use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
Step 4: Connect to Firebase
In the JavaScript code, use Firebase methods to:
authenticate users
fetch and display product data
store orders and cart details
update products from admin
Step 5: Logging
Implement JavaScript-based logging to capture user actions, e.g., login, order placed, product added, etc.
This helps in debugging and tracking activity for the admin.
Step 6: Test the System
Register as a user, log in, browse products, add to cart, place an order.
Check the Firestore database for updates.
Log in as admin, add products, see orders.
Step 7: Deploy
Once the system is working locally, you can host it on Firebase Hosting.
Then it is accessible to any user with internet access.
