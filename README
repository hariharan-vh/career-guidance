How to Use:

For Login: Enter any email address and any password into the fields. For example, you can type test@example.com and password123. Click the "Login" button.

For Sign Up: Click the "Sign Up" button at the bottom. On the signup page, enter any new email and password. Click "Sign Up." It will then prompt you to log in with those (simulated) credentials.
